# Full-Stack Web Technologies Portfolio (MSc Computer Science)

##  Executive Summary
This repository represents the cumulative output of the **Web Technologies  module. Over the course of **10 weeks**, this project explores the complete software development lifecycle, evolving from static frontend design to complex, data-driven backend architecture. The portfolio highlights the shift from simple information display to interactive, logic-driven ecosystems, demonstrating proficiency across multiple technology stacks including **HTML5/CSS3**, **PHP**, **ASP.NET**, and **JSP**.

##  Technical Architecture & Implementation
The coursework is divided into distinct phases, each targeting specific learning outcomes related to data processing, interface design, and system security.

### 1. Client-Side Engineering (Part A)
The frontend phase focuses on constructing robust user interfaces using **HTML5** and **Semantic Web** standards. Rather than relying on generic markup, this project utilizes semantic tags (e.g., `<header>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`) to optimize the application for accessibility and Search Engine Optimization (SEO).

**Core Competencies:**
*   **Native Multimedia**: Implementation of HTML5 audio and video elements to deliver rich media experiences without external plugins.
*   **Adaptive Design**: Application of **CSS3** media queries to guarantee a seamless visual experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
*   **Dynamic Interactivity**: Leveraging **JavaScript** and **AJAX** to manipulate the DOM asynchronously, enabling data updates without requiring a full page refresh.

### 2. Backend Development & CMS (Part B)
The second phase delves into server-side operations, analyzing how web servers manage the **Request-Response cycle**.
*   **Server-Side Scripting**: This section compares and implements three major backend technologies—**PHP**, **ASP.NET**, and **JSP**—to generate dynamic content and manage server logic.
*   **CMS Architecture**: A deep dive into **WordPress** deployment, demonstrating how Content Management Systems utilize relational databases, themes, and plugins to streamline web publishing.

### 3. DevOps, Security & Infrastructure
To mirror professional environments, this portfolio adheres to strict DevOps and security standards using **WAMP/XAMPP** for local testing and **Git** for version control.
*   **Cybersecurity Measures**: The application is hardened against common vulnerabilities by implementing **input sanitization** to prevent **SQL Injection** and **XSS** attacks, alongside secure **password hashing/salting**.
*   **Access Governance**: Implementation of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to enforce strict separation of duties between administrators and standard users.

##  Project Outcomes
This portfolio bridges the gap between static web design and functional software engineering. It validates the ability to build, secure, and deploy maintainable web applications using industry-standard protocols (FTP) and modern architectural patterns.
