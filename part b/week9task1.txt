✅ 1. User Registration & Login Workflow

Shows how to build a user registration form in HTML that takes username, password, and email.

Explains how to process that form with PHP and store the user in a MySQL database.

✅ 2. Database Setup

You learn how to create a simple users table with fields for:

UserID (Primary Key)

Username

Password

EmailAddress
This table stores all user information securely.

✅ 3. Using PHP Sessions

The tutorial introduces PHP sessions (session_start()) to track logged-in users.

After successful login, user data (like username and email) is stored in the session so that you can show personalized pages or restrict access to members only.

✅ 4. User Login Logic

It shows how PHP checks whether form input matches a record in the database.

If the credentials are correct, the user is logged in and redirected to a private “Member Area”.

✅ 5. Simple Security Concepts

The tutorial introduces basic security practices:

Cleaning database input (using escaping functions).

Hashing passwords before storage (e.g., using md5() in the example).
Note: md5() is shown for beginners but in real applications you should use stronger hashing like password_hash()/password_verify() in modern PHP.

✅ 6. Logout Feature

It also shows how to destroy a session so the user can log out safely.

✅ 7. Styling the Pages

Basic CSS (style.css) is included to make the forms and member pages look presentable.

This helps students understand that back-end logic and front-end design work together.
