Overview

ASP (Active Server Pages) and JSP (JavaServer Pages) are server-side web technologies used to create dynamic web content. Unlike static HTML pages, these technologies allow developers to generate web pages dynamically by processing logic on the server before the content is sent to the user’s browser

ASP (Active Server Pages)
What is ASP?

ASP is a Microsoft-developed server-side scripting technology used primarily with the IIS (Internet Information Services) web server. It allows developers to embed scripts (usually VBScript or C# in ASP.NET) within HTML pages.

Key Features:

Runs on the server, not the client

Integrates tightly with Windows servers

Supports database connectivity (e.g. SQL Server)

Used to create dynamic and data-driven websites

Commonly evolved into ASP.NET, which is more powerful and secure

Typical Uses:

Login and authentication systems

Database-driven web applications

Enterprise-level web systems

JSP (JavaServer Pages)
What is JSP?

JSP is a Java-based server-side technology developed by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle). It allows Java code to be embedded into HTML pages and runs on Java application servers such as Apache Tomcat.

Key Features:

Platform-independent (runs on any OS with Java)

Uses Java, making it highly scalable and secure

Often combined with Servlets

Strong support for enterprise applications

Typical Uses:

Large-scale web applications

Enterprise and cloud-based systems

Applications requiring portability and scalability

Comparison: ASP vs JSP
Feature	ASP	JSP
Language	VBScript / C#	Java
Platform	Windows-based	Cross-platform
Web Server	IIS	Apache Tomcat
Performance	Good	Very high
Scalability	Medium–High	High
Enterprise Use	Yes	Yes
Why These Technologies Matter

Understanding ASP and JSP helps developers:

Compare different server-side approaches

Choose suitable technologies for different projects

Understand how modern frameworks evolved

Appreciate backend web development concepts

These technologies are alternatives to PHP and help demonstrate how dynamic web content can be delivered using different programming ecosystems.
